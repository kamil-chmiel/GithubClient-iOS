# GitHub Client (iOS)

Hi Azimo Team!
This is the repository of my GitHub Client which I made for the second internship task. It was such a great opportunity to learn something new and challenge myself.
I've tried to make it testable and written two simple test by implementing Dependendy Injection pattern and Swinject framework.

Hope you like it :)
